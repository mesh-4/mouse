# Mouse

Should be a clean single page crawler machine at first stage.

Look forward to make it able to note down all the action of user and transform it to dataset for machine learning.

1. crawl selected anchor and it href's article
2. track mouse and scroll event in iframe
3. turn track data into dataset
4. try to let server simulate user movement(selenium or puppeteer somewhat)
5. make RLHF I think?

Conclution: fuck my life
